Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan to implement a payment upload functionality under bookkeeping, where users can upload an image of a UPI payment, extract details from the image, and insert the payment details into the Supabase table maintenance_bills:

Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
1. UI: Add Payment Upload Component
Add a new UI section under Bookkeeping for "Upload UPI Payment".
Add a file/image upload input to allow users to upload a UPI payment screenshot/image.
Add any necessary fields for manual override (optional).
2. Backend/Frontend: Image Processing & OCR
Integrate an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library or API (e.g., Tesseract.js for frontend, or Google Vision API for backend) to extract text from the uploaded image.
Parse the extracted text to identify relevant payment details:
UPI Transaction ID
Amount Paid
Date of Payment
Payer/Payee info (if available)
Show extracted details to the user for confirmation/editing.
3. Data Mapping & Validation
Map the extracted details to the columns in your maintenance_bills table:
resident_id (may need user selection or lookup)
month_year (parse from payment date or user input)
amount_due (from OCR)
due_date (could be set or inferred)
status (default or set as 'Paid')
Validate the data and allow the user to correct any errors.
4. Supabase Integration: Insert Payment Record
Use Supabase client libraries to insert a new row into the maintenance_bills table with the extracted and validated details.
Handle errors and show success/failure messages to the user.
5. Optional: Link to Resident/Auto-Matching
(Optional) Implement logic to auto-match the payment to a resident based on UPI ID, phone number, or other extracted info.
Allow manual selection if auto-match fails.
6. Testing & UX Polish
Test with various UPI payment screenshots to ensure robust extraction.
Add loading indicators, error handling, and user feedback.
Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
Example Tech Stack Choices
Frontend: React/TypeScript (TSX), Tesseract.js for OCR
Backend (if needed): Node.js/Express or serverless function for heavy OCR or Google Vision API
Database: Supabase (Postgres)
Image Upload: Local (browser) or to Supabase Storage
